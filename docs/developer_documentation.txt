1. Project Structure
   - client: Rust application for rendering and client-side logic, embeds Python for game objects, serves HTML/JS UI.
   - server: Rust authoritative server, handles game state and physics, may embed Python for server-side logic.
   - studio: Rust application for creating and editing game servers (like Roblox Studio).
   - shared: Shared Rust code between projects.

2. Building the Project
   Each project (client, server, studio) is built separately with Cargo.
   Ensure you have Rust, Python, and Node.js (for web assets) installed.

3. Running the Project
   - Server: cargo run --bin server
   - Client: cargo run --bin client
   - Studio: cargo run --bin studio

4. Architecture
   - The server is authoritative and uses a fixed tick rate.
   - The client uses Python for game object definitions and logic.
   - The UI is web-based and communicates with the Rust client via a local web server.

5. Extending the Game
   - Add new game objects in client/python/.
   - Modify the network protocol in shared/src/protocol.rs.
   - Create new UI components in client/web/.
